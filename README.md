Search-engine
=============

Basic search engine implemented in Python and the Google App Engine by Nathan Collings

Overview
--------

This was originaly a project for the Udacity "Building a Search Engine" class that I took some time ago.
I've since decided to try and dust it off and improve it a bit. I decided to try and implement it in
the Google App Engine, which was somewhat succesfull. However, it puts a ton of read/write access on
the datastore, resulting in me reaching my App Engine quotas way too quickly...so I'll likely end up just
implementing this locally for now.

It's still got a fair number of bugs and things that need to be done to get this working properly and
effectively.
